## Comparative Analysis of Web Archive Techniques and Website Accessibility


This repository contains the code and documentation for a project that aims to compare different web archiving techniques and evaluate website accessibility changes over time using AI-Inspector and IBM Accessibility Checker.



# Introduction

Web archiving is crucial for preserving digital content and ensuring its accessibility for future generations. This project focuses on web archiving techniques: Wayback Machine, ArchiveBox, Archave.today and Perma.cc, and evaluates their effectiveness in preserving web content. Additionally, the project examines changes in website accessibility between archived and current versions using AI-Inspector and IBM Accessibility Checker.




# Web Archiving Techniques

Wayback Machine: The Wayback Machine archives web pages and provides access to historical versions.


ArchiveBox: ArchiveBox is a self-hosted web archiving tool used for personal or organizational archiving purposes.


Archave.today: Archive.today is a web archiving service that allows users to capture and preserve snapshots of web pages for future reference.


Perma.cc: Perma.cc is a service for creating permanent citations to web sources.



# Accessibility Evaluation Tools

AI-Inspector: AI-Inspector is a tool for evaluating website accessibility using AI-powered analysis.


IBM Accessibility Checker: IBM Accessibility Checker is a tool provided by IBM for assessing website accessibility.


# Data Collection Process
Selection of websites for analysis.
Use of each web archiving technique to collect archived versions of the websites.
Use of AI-Inspector and IBM Accessibility Checker to evaluate accessibility of archived and current versions.

# Analysis
Comparison of archived versions obtained from Wayback Machine, ArchiveBox, Archive.today and Perma.cc with the current versions of selected websites.
Assessment of accessibility changes between archived and current versions using AI-Inspector and IBM Accessibility Checker.

# Results
Summary of observed changes in website content and structure between archived and current versions.
Evaluation of accessibility improvements or regressions over time.

# Discussion
Interpretation of results in the context of web archiving practices and website accessibility.
Consideration of factors influencing differences between archived and current versions.
Implications for web archiving strategies and accessibility maintenance.
